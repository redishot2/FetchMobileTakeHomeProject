### Build tools & versions used
Created using Xcode 15.4

### Summary: Include screen shots or a video of your app highlighting its features

### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
UI makes the biggest impact when you're using an app, so UI is where I spent the most time.

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
About 6 hours. I started with the networking and codable classes so I could have some data to work with. Then I moved on to the UI. I probably spent the most amount of time here perfecting the look and experimenting with features. Then I moved on to tests and any other requirements I may have missed.

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
UI is my favorite so I could have kept going on a lot of it. Rows for all the cuisine types. Scrollview paging with animations. I had to limit myself to just doing what the project asked for so it wouldn't get too large. 

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
The caching. I outsourced the image networking to a dependency to save time. This had a downside of obfuscating the network error handling so I only came up with 2 cases (bad url and couldn't decode) to be displayed to the user.
